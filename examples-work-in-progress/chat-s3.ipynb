      "- Billing issues: duplicate charges, unclear invoices/charges, confusing refund process.\n",
      "- Refunds: hard to request, unclear timelines.\n",
      "- Onboarding for alerts: dashboard looks good but users get lost setting up alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "What to improve (prioritized, actionable):\n",
      "1) Fix billing pain quickly\n",
      "- Prevent double charges: enforce idempotency keys on payment/renewal calls, de-dupe webhook events, tighten retry logic.\n",
      "- Make billing clear in-app: invoice breakdown (plan, proration, taxes, discounts), upcoming charges, next renewal date, “Why was I charged?” explainer next to each line item.\n",
      "- Improve emails: plain-language invoice and payment-failure emails with cause, next steps, and links to billing page.\n",
      "- SLA for billing tickets: fast lane triage (e.g., 4 business hours first response, 48 hours resolution), dedicated “Billing” queue.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Simplify refunds and communicate timelines\n",
      "- Self-serve refund request flow: pick charge, select reason, auto-calc eligibility, show expected timeline, and live status tracker.\n",
      "- Clear refund policy page and in-app link from Billing and Help. Summarize eligibility, window, partial vs full refunds, and typical processing time.\n",
      "- Support macros: one-click replies that explain refund steps, timeline, and how to track status.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) Make alerts setup obvious\n",
      "- Guided tour/walkthrough for first-time alert setup with inline tips.\n",
      "- Preset templates (e.g., “Usage spike,” “Payment failed,” “Latency above X ms”) and recommended defaults.\n",
      "- Improved empty states with examples and a “Create your first alert” button.\n",
      "- Contextual help: tooltips and a “?” panel linking to a short how-to.\n",
      "\n",
      "4) Keep support excellence, add proactive billing help\n",
      "- Train support to proactively explain refund timelines and billing breakdowns.\n",
      "- Escalation path to a billing specialist for charge disputes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Measurement and guardrails\n",
      "- KPIs: billing-related ticket rate, duplicate-charge incidence, refund handling time, CSAT for Billing tickets, alert-setup completion rate and time-to-first-alert, invoice email open/click rates, overall NPS.\n",
      "- Run 5–7 usability tests on billing and alert setup; target >90% task completion in <3 minutes.\n",
      "- A/B test billing copy and alert templates to improve comprehension and setup rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rollout plan\n",
      "- 0–2 weeks: new invoice/refund email templates, refund policy page, support macros, billing ticket fast-lane, add help links in billing and alerts pages.\n",
      "- 2–6 weeks: billing dashboard breakdown and “Why was I charged?” explainers; guided alert tour and templates.\n",
      "- 6–10 weeks: self-serve refund flow with status tracker; anomaly detection for duplicate charges.\n",
